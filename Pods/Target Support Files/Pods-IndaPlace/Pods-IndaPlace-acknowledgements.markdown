## HEREMapsStarter

# HERE iOS SDK, Starter Edition

This document contains information about the `HEREMapsStarter` pod for CocoaPods. The `HEREMapsStarter` pod contains the Starter Edition of the HERE iOS SDK.

HERE iOS SDK supports both Objective-C and Swift. With the Starter Edition, developers can build immersive, geographically-aware iOS applications by leveraging a powerful and flexible mapping platform. Through this SDK, developers can add rich location features such as routing, interactive maps, and global place search to their applications. The powerful client-side HERE iOS SDK also includes a sophisticated engine for rendering map data and calculated routes.

There are two iOS SDKs available from HERE for iOS developers. The Premium Edition of the HERE iOS SDK is available as the pod `HEREMaps`. You can find a feature comparison of the two on [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com/develop/mobile-sdks).
